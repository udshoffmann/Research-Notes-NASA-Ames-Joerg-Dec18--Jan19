\section{XPP Framework (from IJCAI'19 paper draft)}
\label{xpp-framework}

We first introduce our approach making minimal assumptions on the
planning context and plan properties concerned. This serves to
identify the generic structure of the explainability problems we
target. That structure can then be instantiated with concrete planning
formalisms and plan-property languages of interest, as we will
exemplify in later sections.




\subsection{Planning Tasks and Plans}

We assume some formalism defining planning \defined{tasks} \task. We
do not need any assumptions about that formalism, except that it
defines a concept of \defined{plans} \plan, where that concept can
again be arbitrary (action sequence/schedule/partial order/etc). 

Our definitions are relative to a set of plans \plans\ of
interest. The canonical setup we have in mind is that where \plans\ is
\defined{implicit}, induced by \task\ as the set of \plan\ that
achieve a set of \defined{enforced} plan properties. But
\defined{explicit} \plans, given as a list of plans in the input, can
also be relevant if the user wants to focus the analysis on a
narrow/small subset of candidate plans. In either case, our framework
addresses dependencies between \defined{analyzed} plan properties
within \plans.

%% Our definitions are relative to a set of plans \plans\ of interest:

%% under any circumstance. But \defined{explicit} \plans, given as a list
%% of plans in the input, can also be relevant if the user wants to focus
%% the analysis on a narrow/small subset of candidate plans. Whichever is
%% the case, the analysis considers dependencies between \defined{soft}
%% plan properties within \plans. These properties can be soft goals as
%% in oversubscription planning, but they can also be arbitrary
%% constraints characterizing the manner in which the hard plan
%% properties are achieved. For example, in classical planning,
%% \plans\ can simply be the set of (cost-optimal) plans achieving the
%% goal, where our analysis answers questions about the properties of
%% such plans.





\subsection{Plan Properties and Property Entailment}

Plan properties, in their most general form, are simply functions
mapping a task and plan to a Boolean value indicating whether or not
the property is satisfied:

\begin{definition}[Plan Property]
Denoting by \alltasks\ the set of all tasks and by \allplans\ the set
of all plans, a \emph{plan property} is a partial function $\prop :
\alltasks \times \allplans \mapsto \{\true, \false\}$. Given a task
\task\ and a set of plans \plans, we say that \prop\ is a plan
property defined on \task\ and \plans\ if its domain includes
$\{(\task,\plan) \mid \plan \in \plans\}$.
\end{definition}

Example plan properties are goal facts/goal formulas (true at end of
plan?), temporal plan trajectory constraints, constraints on subsets
of actions used/not used, deadlines, bounds on resource consumption,
etc. Canonically, $\prop$ is computable in time polynomial in the size
of its input.

We assume a set \props\ of plan properties (the analyzed ones) as part
of our input. In this context, a distinction not necessary for our
generic definitions, but important in practice, is that between
\defined{atomic} vs.\ \defined{composed} plan properties. The set
\propsatom\ of atomic properties is listed explicitly in the input,
whereas the composed properties \propscomp\ arise from a compact
specification how properties can be combined. For example, one may
define \propscomp\ to be propositional formulas over the atoms
\propsatom. Note that, given this, the set $\props = \propsatom \cup
\propscomp$ of plan properties whose dependencies are being analyzed
may be exponentially larger than the user input, and may even be
infinite.

As a concrete instance we will consider later on, the user may be
interested in a set $G$ of soft-goal facts, where for each $g \in G$
being or not being achieved by a plan $\plan \in \plans$ is an atomic
goal property. But the interesting dependencies may be, not across
individual $g$, but over conjunctions thereof (\eg\ if conjunctions,
but not typically singletons, exclude the possibility to achieve other
goals). The input to our analysis then is merely the set $G$, while
the analysis considers dependencies across all conjunctions over $G$.

The kind of dependency our framework focusses on is entailment over
plan properties, in the space of truth-value assignments induced by
the plan-candidate set \plans:

\begin{definition}[Entailment]
Let \task\ be a task and \plans\ a set of plans. Let \props\ be a set
of plan properties defined on \task\ and \plans.

Let $\plan \in \plans$. We identify \plan\ with the truth-value
assignment $\plan : \props \mapsto \{\true, \false\}$ where
$\plan(\prop) := \prop(\task,\plan)$. We identify \plans\ with the set
of such truth-value assignments. We say that
\plan\ \defined{satisfies} \prop, written $\plan \models \prop$, if
$\plan(\prop) = \true$. We denote by $\modelsof{\plans}{\prop} :=
\{\plan \mid \plan \in \plans, \plan \models \prop\}$ the models of
\prop. We say that \prop\ is \defined{satisfiable} in \plans\ if
$\modelsof{\plans}{\prop} \neq \emptyset$.

We say that \prop\ \defined{entails} \propq\ in \plans, written
$\entails{\plans}{\prop}{\propq}$, if $\modelsof{\plans}{\prop}
\subseteq \modelsof{\plans}{\propq}$.
%
We say that \prop\ and \propq\ are \defined{equivalent} in \plans,
written $\iff{\plans}{\prop}{\propq}$, if $\modelsof{\plans}{\prop} =
\modelsof{\plans}{\propq}$. The subset of \props\ equivalent with
\prop\ in \plans\ is written $\equiv{\plans}{\prop} := \{\propq \mid
\propq \in \props, \iff{\plans}{\prop}{\propq}\}$.
\end{definition}

This definition essentially just views plans $\plan \in \plans$ as
truth-value assignments in the obvious manner. Entailment and
equivalence over plan properties are then defined straightforwardly,
with \plans\ in the role traditionally taken by a knowledge base that
restricts the truth-value assignments under consideration. Recall that
formulas over plan properties can be encoded as individual composed
plan properties, so that defining entailment over individual plan
properties is enough to permit logical combinations thereof.

Importantly, the role of \plans\ as a knowledge base means that
entailment in \plans\ is more than standard entailment: the latter
implies the former, but not vice versa. As a simple example, say the
plan properties \props\ are propositional formulas $\phi$ over facts,
evaluated at the end of the plan. Then $\phi \Rightarrow \psi$ implies
that $\entails{\plans}{\phi}{\psi}$, simply because any (plan-end)
state that satisfies $\phi$ must satisfy $\psi$. But not vice versa:
\eg\ if facts $p, q$ are mutex in the task then
$\entails{\plans}{p}{\neg q}$. As a more motivating example, say the
plan properties are goals (like having scientific observations in
satellite planning) as well as resource constraints (like consuming at
most a given amount of energy). Then entailments of interest can take
the form $\entails{\plans}{p}{\neg q_1 \vee \neg q_2 \vee \neg q_3}$
saying that we cannot have $p$ without foregoing either of $q_1$ or
$q_2$ or $q_3$. Note that this is an entailment specific to \plans,
which may not hold in general (\eg\ if cheaper actions are available,
or if cheaper plans are admitted by removing some other hard
goals). It is precisely the identification of such specific
entailments -- specific to the space \plans\ of plans considered --
that motivates our approach.





\subsection{Plan-Space Explanation Problems}

Our plan-space explanation problems consist in identifying the
entailment relation on \props\ given the knowledge base \plans:

\begin{definition}[PDO and PDA]
Let \task\ be a task and \plans\ a set of plans. Let \props\ be a set
of plan properties defined on \task\ and \plans.

The \defined{plan-property dependency order (PDO)} for \plans\ and
\props\ is the partial order $\pdo{\plans}$ over the equivalence
classes $\equiv{\plans}{\prop}$, where $\equiv{\plans}{\prop}
\pdo{\plans} \equiv{\plans}{\propq}$ iff
$\entails{\plans}{\prop}{\propq}$.

A set $\pda{\plans} \subseteq \props$ is a \defined{plan-property
  dependency axiomatization (PDA)} for \plans\ and \props\ if, for
every minimal element $\equiv{\plans}{\prop}$ of $\pdo{\plans}$
restricted to \prop\ satisfiable in \plans, $\pda{\plans}$ contains
exactly one member of $\equiv{\plans}{\prop}$.
\end{definition}

% Joerg: not really needed, and potentially confusing in terms of what
% ``computing the PDO'' actually means -- how to represent the
% equivalence classes?
%
%% We refer by the \defined{PDO problem} to the computational problem of
%% computing the PDO given \task\ as well as a (compact) specification of
%% \props. Accordingly for the \defined{PDA problem}.

The PDO is a plan-space explanation in the sense of making explicit
how the plan properties of interest depend on each other -- saying
things like ``we cannot have $p$ without foregoing either of $q_1$ or
$q_2$ or $q_3$''. The PDO is exhaustive, and in that sense the ideal
plan-space explanation in principle. In practice though its size, \ie,
the number of equivalence classes, may be problematic. If one is
interested in atomic plan properties only, specified explicitly in the
user input, then \props\ and hence the PDO is small. If
\props\ includes composed properties though, then showing a PDA may be
more suitable.

A PDA captures the strongest properties, that together entail all
other properties given \plans\ -- and that, in this sense, form an
axiomatization for \plans. Unsatisfiable properties are not of
interest here as they trivially entail everything. For example, in
oversubscription planning, when plan properties are conjunctions of
soft goals, larger conjunctions entail smaller ones and a PDA
specifies the maximal solvable conjunctions.

%% We remark that the PDO is a meet-semilattice if $\props$ is closed
%% under conjunction, \ie, for every satisfiable $p, q \in \props$ there
%% is a satisfiable $r \in \props$ which is true if both $p$ and $q$ are
%% true. In this case, the PDA is a single plan property ... JOERG:
%% whatever. not gonna happen/who cares.
%
%% \joerg{reg lattices: $O$ is a ``meet-semilattice'' if $\Phi$ is closed
%%   under conjunction: in a lattice, every two elements need to have a
%%   common ancestor. in standard logic, entailment over formula
%%   equivalence classes is a lattice because for any $\phi$ and $\psi$
%%   $\phi \wedge \psi$ is a common ancestor; actually a bounded lattice,
%%   with a unique element that is an ancestor to (that implies)
%%   everything else. the same is true here if $\Phi$ is closed under
%%   conjunction (because if each of $\phi$ and $\psi$ is valid, then so
%%   is $\phi \wedge \psi$). In this case, the PDA is the unique common
%%   ancestor, which can basically be thought of as a conjunction of
%%   axioms. In lattice terminology, the unique common ancestor is called
%%   a ``least element'', ``minimum'', or ``bottom'' element; but I think
%%   none of these names makes much sense in our context so I would leave
%%   it at the above definition, maybe briefly remarking here that $O$ is
%%   a meet-semilattice if $\Phi$ is closed under conjunction.}

The PDO is finite if only atomic plan properties are considered,
simply as the number of truth-value assignments is. In the presence of
an infinite set of composed plan properties (such as propositional
formulas), the PDO may still be finite due to considering equivalence
classes. In particular, the latter is necessarily the case if the set
of plans \plans\ of interest is finite (as is the case \eg\ if the
action set is finite and plan size can be finitely bounded), because
then there is only a finite number of non-equivalent plan properties.

Regarding complexity, if \plans\ is implicitly given, then testing
plan-property satisfiability encompasses the plan existence problem
even for extremely simple plan properties (\eg, asking whether the
plan achieves some fact $p$). Similarly for plan-property entailments
$\entails{\plans}{\prop}{\propq}$, proving which corresponds to
proving a planning task unsolvable (there exists no plan that
satisfies \prop\ but not \propq). Tractable cases are limited to
explicitly given \plans, and planning fragments where \plans\ -- the
set of all plans -- can be generated in polynomial time. This is
exacerbated by the potentially exponential size of the PDO, and the
PDA, for composed plan properties. Certainly, both the PDO and PDA
problems should ideally be solved offline, prior to interaction with a
user. As our experimental results show, however, in a variety of
benchmarks, computing a PDA has similar scalability as optimal
planning, and the size of a PDA is reasonably small for human
inspection.


% Joerg: a fully formal frame here would need to talk about
% compilations, also of planning tasks ... overkill, instead formulate
% what's needed in the concrete instances here when we get there.
%
%% A property we will rely on in the following sections is that sometimes
%% a PDA for a plan-property set $\props^B$ can be easily obtained from
%% that for a plan-property set $\props^A$:
%
%% \begin{definition}[PDA Derivability]
%% Let $\props^A$ and $\props^B$ be sets of plan properties. We say that
%% a PDA for $\props^B$ is \defined{polynomially derivable} from that for
%% $\props^A$ if there exists an algorithm that runs in time polynomial
%% in the size of its input and that, for any task \task\ on which all
%% $\prop \in \props^A \cup \props^B$ are defined, transforms a PDA for
%% $\props^A$ into one for $\props^B$.
%% \end{definition}
