\section{XPP: Explaining the Space of Plans through Plan-Property Dependencies (Joerg \& Dan AFOSR Project)}
\label{xpp}

Executive abstract: identify implications over Boolean plan
properties, a la "if a plan has property A then it must have/cannot
have property B"; 2) instead of just computing these implications over
a given set of dependencies, automatically "mine" the task for the
most relevant properties given the user's interests. More details see
Appendix~\ref{xpp-abstract}.

Paper in preparation for IJCAI'19: introduces generic framework;
instantiates that framework with goal-fact-conjunction dependencies in
oversubscription planning (like classical planing but with a single
consumed resource of which not enough is given to achieve all goals);
shows that the analysis for "action constraints" (plan properties
taking the form of propositional formulas over the atoms "plan uses at
least one action from action subset $A_i$", where $A_i$ is from a
given collection of distinguished action subsets) can be compiled into
the analysis of goal-fact-conjunction dependencies; shows that LTL
plan trajectory constraints can be compiled into the analysis of
goal-fact-conjunction dependencies; runs experiments on adapted IPC
benchmarks. Paper draft see
